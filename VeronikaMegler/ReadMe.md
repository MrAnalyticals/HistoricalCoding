Veronika Megler, born in 1960, is an Australian computer scientist. Megler is currently principal data scientist at Amazon Web Services, 
and is well known as the co-developer of The Hobbit, a 1982 text adventure game adapted from the novel by J. R. R. Tolkien.
As quoted in a recent newspaper article Veronica said , of the Hobbit, "I saw the possibility of what could be done – so I did it". 
 

At only 20 years old Veronika undertook a large commercial coding project having only just learnt how to code! The proof of her
intelligence is evidenced by her now working as a principal data scientist at Amazon Web Services (AWS) and obtaining a PhD in 
computer science. 
 

Veronika said : “There were essentially message templates and a dictionary of words, and a lot of the power of the 
game comes from the fact that there are just three or four basic ideas that interact with a fair amount of randomness to
create what can be called emergent behaviour.”
